# Hyndman: Exercise 9.1

Figure 9.32 shows the ACFs for 36 random numbers, 360 random numbers and 1,000 random numbers.

![Figure 9.32](nine1.png)

**Explain the differences among these figures. Do they all indicate that the data are white noise?**

_Each of the ACF plots is demonstrative of a 'white noise' signal - i.e., the mean of the residuals is ~ zero and there are no indications of autocorrelation within the datasets._

**Why are the critical values at different distances from the mean of zero? Why are the autocorrelations different in each figure when they each refer to white noise?**

_The Y-axis on an ACF plot spans from -1 to 1 and reflects a range of possible correlation coefficients associated with the lag values. The dashed horizontal lines (critical values) indicate the statistical threshold for significance. These values decrease as the number of observations increase and the correlation estimates stabilize (i.e., residual errors decrease)._


# Hyndman: Exercise 9.2 

**A classic example of a non-stationary series are stock prices. Plot the daily closing prices for Amazon stock (contained in gafa_stock), along with the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows that the series is non-stationary and should be differenced.**

_Figure 1. AMZN's closing stock time series increases over time with possible seasonal adjustments (intra-annual). These features are obvious signatures of nonstationarity._ 

_Figure 2. The ACF plot highlights significant autocorrelation at all lags, indicating non-stationarity._ 

_Figure 3. The PACF plot shows significant partial autocorrelation at lags 4, 19, and 25, indicating non_stationarity._

# Hyndman: Exercise 9.3

**For your retail data (from Exercise 8 in Section 2.10), find the appropriate order of differencing (after transformation if necessary) to obtain stationary data.**

_There are is a clear upward trend, seasonal signal, and nonconstant variance in the Industry turnover data (Figure 12)._

_A log transformation on Turnover was applied to reduce heteroskedasticity (Figure 13)._

_STL decomposition was applied to extract a seasonally adjusted series (Figure 14). There does appear to be some grouping patterns in the remainder._

_A unit root ndiff test on the seasonally adjusted data indicated a need for single differencing (Table 6)._

_A unit root kpss test on the differenced data indicated that no further differencing was required to achieve stationarity (Table 5 and Figure 15)._

_An ACF plot of the differenced data (stationary) indicates continuing issues with lag autocorrelation (Figure 16). These were minimized using a 5 year seasonal window in the STL decomposition._

**Try some other plausible models by experimenting with the orders chosen;**

```{r}

# select model from set of options

options<-usgdp%>%
  model(gdp110 = ARIMA(box_cox(gdp_capita, lambda_gdp) ~ 1 + pdq(1,1,0)),
        gdp011 = ARIMA(box_cox(gdp_capita, lambda_gdp) ~ 1 + pdq(0,1,1)),
        gdp022 =ARIMA(gdp_capita ~ 1+pdq(0,2,2)),  # untransformed, twice differenced based on auto.arima()
        stepwise=ARIMA(box_cox(gdp_capita, lambda_gdp)),
        search=ARIMA(box_cox(gdp_capita, lambda_gdp), stepwise=FALSE))


# Review diagnostics

report(options)


```


**Choose what you think is the best model and check the residual diagnostics;**

_ARIMA(1,1,0) results on the lambda transformed data are identical to those calculated by search and stepwise models. Diagnostics for the former indicate white noise and no remaining autocorrelation._

```{r}
# plot model diagnostics

options%>%
  select(gdp110)%>%
  gg_tsresiduals()+
  labs(title='Figure 35. Diagnostics for US Per Capita GDP Time Series: ARIMA(1,1,0)')

```

**Produce forecasts of your fitted model. Do the forecasts look reasonable?**

_Yes, the forecast looks reasonable._

```{r}
gdp110.drift%>%
  forecast(h = 10) %>%
  autoplot(usgdp) +
  labs(title = 'Figure 36. US GDP (Lambda) 10-year forecast: ARIMA(1,1,0) with Drift.')+
  theme_classic()
```


**Compare the results with what you would obtain using ETS() (with no transformation).**

_This model will not include a Box-Cox transformation but GDP will be reported on a per-capita basis. We will apply a non-seasonal ETS (AAN) model and forecast for 10 year period._

_Visually the results of the ETS(AAN) and ARIMA(1,1,0) (with transformation) are identical. We can make this comparison quantitatively using cross-validation._

_Results of cross-validation (Table 6: see RMSE and MAPE) indicate that the ARIMA model produces a better fit than the ETS model._

#build ETS model
